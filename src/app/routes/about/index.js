                I am a crazy product enthusiast who hails from an Engineering
                background possessing an undying craze for problem-solving.
              </p>

              <p>
                I started as an engineer experimenting with microprocessors, got
                curious, and grew into more holistic roles like Full-stack
                development and Product Management. Curiosity shaped my
                journey all along!
              </p>
              <p>
                I have 3+ years of industry experience and built meaningful,
                intuitive products with a customer-centric mindset. This helped
                me develop an engineerâ€™s mind, a designerâ€™s intuition, and an
                entrepreneurâ€™s vision.{" "}

              <p>
                Currently, Iâ€™m working as a Full-stack Developer(MTS-2) in
                Verizon, India.

                My expertise includes both front end technologies such as
                Javascript, React, HTML, CSS, and back end technologies include
                Java, Python, NodeJs, Express.
